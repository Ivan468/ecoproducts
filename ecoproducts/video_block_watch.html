          <h3>Watch Our Newest Success Story</h3>
          <p>
            Not only do we get our products lab tested for compostability, we
            also test them out in the real world. We worked together with A1
            Organics and the Compost Manufacturing Alliance (CMA) to confirm
            that our products break down as we intend into usable compost.
          </p>

          <p>
            This type of collaboration between the composting industry and the
            compostable products industry on real-world field testing is
            critical to ensure that the products brought to our compost partners
            will actually break down at their sites.
          </p>
          <h3>Meet our Partners in Grime</h3>
          <p>
            We look forward to continued partnership and collaboration with the
            composting community. We canâ€™t do it alone, but through partnerships
            like these, we can make waste diversion happen.
